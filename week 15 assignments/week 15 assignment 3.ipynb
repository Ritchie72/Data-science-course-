    "Ridge Regression is not typically used for feature selection in the traditional sense, as its L2 regularization term tends to shrink coefficients towards zero but not exactly to zero. This means that all features are retained in the model, albeit with reduced impact for those deemed less important. However, Ridge Regression can still provide insights that may inform feature selection, and it can be combined with other techniques for this purpose."
